<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This file explains how to upgrade to a new version of PennMUSH.</p>
<p>There are three basic upgrade situations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You're running a stock (&quot;vanilla&quot;) PennMUSH server of some version and you want to upgrade to a later version</li>
<li>You've hacked your server source code a little bit here and there (adding a flag, for example). Hacks to the *local.c files don't count as hacks, as they're easy to handle.</li>
<li>You've hacked your server source code a lot.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is also a list of upgrade &quot;GOTCHAS&quot; at the end of this file. Please read them.</p>
<p>The PennMUSH developers actually only support situation 1, but we'll give some useful tips for 2 and 3 here, too.</p>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: It is very wise to always back up your current working MUSH directories before you try an upgrade. You were warned.</p>
<h1 id="vanilla-upgrade">Vanilla upgrade</h1>
<p>You have basically three choices here: upgrade with patch files, track a git version control repository, or build a whole new distribution.</p>
<h2 id="upgrading-with-patch-files">Upgrading with patch files</h2>
<p>This is the easiest way to upgrade your source code if you're keeping up with patches as they come out, or if you're upgrading patchlevels within a release (e.g., within 1.8.0).</p>
<p>To upgrade with patch files, get all the patch files for higher patchlevels than your current version. For example, if you're running 1.8.0p0 and the latest version is 1.8.0p4, you need patches 1-4.</p>
<p>Patchfiles can be downloaded via <a href="https://download.pennmush.org/Source/" class="uri">https://download.pennmush.org/Source/</a> and are usually named things like 1.8.0-patch02 (the patch from 1.8.0p1 to 1.8.0p2) or, in some cases, 1.7.6p16-1.8.0p0.patch (the patch from 1.7.6p16 to 1.8.0p0).</p>
<p>Each patch file contains instructions at the top explaining how to apply it. <strong>FOLLOW THESE!</strong> Don't assume they're all the same. The options to use with the patch program change, and sometimes further steps are required.</p>
<p>After you've applied all the patches and followed all the instructions, you should be good to go. In most cases, you can simply <code>@shutdown/reboot</code> after the final successful compile. If <code>@shutdown/reboot</code> crashes, you'll have to restart again.</p>
<h2 id="using-git">Using git</h2>
<pre><code>% git clone https://github.com/pennmush/pennmush.git</code></pre>
<p>To update from the master branch:</p>
<pre><code>% git pull</code></pre>
<p>Each release is tagged; if you don't want to follow the latest changest you can check out a specific one:</p>
<pre><code>% git checkout 186p1</code></pre>
<h2 id="building-a-new-distribution">Building a new distribution</h2>
<p>When you're upgrading across release and no patchlevel is provided to make the upgrade (e.g. from 1.7.4p3 to 1.8.0p0), it's often easier to simply build a new distribution following the INSTALL instructions, but with your old configuration stuff.</p>
<p>Up until 1.8.2p5, all PennMUSH installs unpacked into a directory called pennmush/, so it was necessary to rename your existing directory to something like oldpenn/ prior to unpacking the new version. From 1.8.2p5 and onwards, directory names are version-specific (pennmush-1.8.2p5/), so this is no longer necessary.</p>
<p>All of the steps below should be taken before running <code>./configure</code> for the new version:</p>
<h3 id="options.h-and-game.cnf">options.h and game/*.cnf</h3>
<p>You can copy the options.h file and game/mush.cnf file from your old version to the new version. The <code>make update</code> command (run after <code>configure</code>) will compare your files with the newly distributed ones and tell you about options that have been added or removed. If you have any options defined that the new version doesn't recognize, you'll be asked if you want to retain them (which is safe).</p>
<p>If your mush.cnf file is called something else, copy it to mush.cnf in pennmush/game anyway, since that's the file that gets updated. Then make a link to that file called whatever.cnf if you want to use that.</p>
<p>If you've modified the restart script, you'll have to decide if your modified script is still appropriate, or modify a copy of the distributed game/restart script as you like it. it is highly recommended that you copy restart to a second file, called something like restart.local, and modify and use it instead of the stock restart script to reduce conflicts when patching.</p>
<p>You can also copy your old game/access.cnf, game/names.cnf, and game/txt/*.txt files into the appropriate locations. You may wish to do the same thing for game/restrict.cnf and game/alias.cnf, but you should compare them to the new versions, as restrictions and aliases that may formerly have been compiled into the server may now be specified in the .cnf files instead.</p>
<h3 id="srclocal.c">src/*local.c</h3>
<p>You should copy local.c, cmdlocal.c, and funlocal.c from oldpenn/src to pennmush/src if you want to retain this local code. Of course, it may not still work, but it's quite likely that it will. If you don't have any such code, you can skip this step.</p>
<h3 id="databases">Databases</h3>
<p>If you are upgrading from 1.7.4 (or earlier) to 1.7.7 (or later), you must first load your old database under PennMUSH 1.7.6 and then dump it, and load this converted database under your target version of PennMUSH. PennMUSH 1.7.7+ can no longer read 1.7.4 databases.</p>
<p>If you are upgrading from 1.7.6 or certain 1.7.7 versions, you may also first need to load your database under PennMUSH 1.8.0p13 and then dump it, and load this converted database under your target version of PennMUSH.</p>
<h1 id="pennmush-with-a-few-hacks">PennMUSH with a few hacks</h1>
<p>When you have only a few local hacks outside of the src/*local.c files, you can often patch up using the patch file method discussed above. Alternatively, you can build a new version and reapply your changes.</p>
<p>One small exception is upgrading from a version that used the old flag system to one that uses the new flag system (post-1.7.7p5), if you've added flags or toggles. You probably had an #define in hdrs/flags.h for your flag's bit value. This now should be moved to hdrs/oldflags.h; you should leave in the table entry in src/flags.c. If you set up a macro for testing your flag in hdrs/mushdb.h, you'll need to change it to use the <code>has_flag_by_name()</code> function - see the many examples in that file.</p>
<p>If this isn't suitable (you're crossing releases or your hacks are too many for this to work cleanly), see below.</p>
<h1 id="pennmush-with-a-lot-of-hacks">PennMUSH with a lot of hacks</h1>
<p>If you've seriously hacked your server source code, you're on your own in terms of keeping up with new patchlevels. Some people apply patchfiles and fix the rejected hunks.</p>
<p>However, this should be easier to do with git. Just fork a copy of the main repository and update from it as needed and deal with merge conflicts through it.</p>
