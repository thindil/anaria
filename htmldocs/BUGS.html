<li><p>You might experience crashes because the default executable stack size is too small. An 8 megabyte stack is more than ample. On unix, it can be raised with <code>ulimit -s 8192</code>. On Windows, you must use the editbin progam that comes with MS development environments to raise the stack on a per-executable basis, via <code>editbin /STACK:8388608 netmush.exe</code></p></li>
<li><p>Some IPv6-enabled systems are not configured out of the box to tunnel IPv4 connection attempts on the same port to the IPv6 socket that is listening. If you can connect to a local game via ::1 but not 127.0.0.1 this is likely the issue. On unix systems, a user with root privileges can do 'sysctl -w net.inet6.ip6.v6only=0', after which you'll have to do a complete shutdown and restart of the mush for the change to take effect. The file /etc/sysctl.conf will have to be changed too so the change persists across server reboots. If that's not practical, you can get an IPv4-only mush by doing the following:</p>
<pre><code>  % ./configure --disable-ipv6
  % make</code></pre>
<p>Then do a full <code>@shutdown</code> of the game and run restart.</p></li>
<li><p>The configure script sometimes detects functions that aren't seen when the mush itself is compiled. Some linux distributions seem to be very prone to this, probably due to customizations of their glibc packages. For now, just comment out the relevant <code>HAVE\_FOO</code> lines from config.h. You'll have to redo this every time you re-run configure. If you can figure out how to make the relevant prototypes and macros visible to Penn, let us know! Some functions known to cause this include <code>posix_fadvise()</code> and <code>posix_fallocate()</code>.</p></li>
