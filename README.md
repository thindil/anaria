### General information

AnariaMUSH is a fork of PennMUSH project, version 1.8.8. Currently, it is almost
identical like PennMUSH, with some changes:

* Works only with OpenSSLv3 or above.
* Fixed warnings reported by Clang and GCC.
* Fixed some issues reported by cppcheck.
* Added a simple WebSocket client, from: https://github.com/grapenut/websockclient
* Removed some old documentation.

The list above will be updated over time. At the moment the work is focused on
removing unnecessary for me options, like Pueblo, multilanguage support or web
server support (not WebSocket support). And the next stage? We will see. :)

Currently, all changes to the project are on the same license as PennMUSH, but
this can change over time to BSD-3 license.

For read the original PennMUSH README.md please look at file
[PennREADME.md](PennREADME.md). All instructions related to PennMUSH apply to
AnariaMUSH too. The same is with mushcode.

I want to thank everyone, who has ever involved into PennMUSH project and
WebsockClient project. For their hard work there. All the best for you and I
hope you had a great time then and now.

That's all for now, as usual, I have probably forgotten about something important ;)
