Penn will compile and run on NetBSD, including OpenSSL
support, with the caveats below. Tested with NetBSD 7.

Some packages need to be installed via pkgsrc if not already present
on the server:

   Required: perl5.
   Optional:  libevent, MariaDB or PostgresSQL, curl and icu.

If set up to install binary packages, pkg_add them. Otherwise, go to
/usr/pkgsrc and install from source. Packages are:
  databases/mysqlXX-client
  databases/postgresqlXX-client
  devel/libevent
  lang/perl5
  textproc/icu
  www/curl
