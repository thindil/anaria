There are a wide variety of different Linux distributions with a lot
of variation in what packages are installed by default and what their
names are. Some common ones have dependencies described below.

* Debian and derived distributions like Ubuntu split libraries up from
   the other files needed to compile code using them. You'll need to
   install at a minimum the following packages:

  | build-essentials libssl-dev 

  Installing libevent-openssl-2.0 is highly recommended as well, but not
  required.  If you want to use SQL, you'll also need the appropriate
  dev package, like libmariadbclient-dev.

   libcurl4-openssl-dev is another useful one, as is libicu-dev.

* For arch, the mandatory packages are:
   | openssl

   and highly recommended icu, libevent and libcurl. Some or all of
   these might already be present as part of a base install.

* RedHat, CentOS and related distributions need the perl-core package
  installed, as their perl package does not actually provide all of a
  base perl environment.

* Ubuntu Required packages:
| build-essential libssl-dev libevent-dev zlib1g-dev 
* Ubuntu Optional:
libicu-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev gperf
