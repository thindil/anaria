configuring PennMUSH on various operating systems. If there isn't one
for your OS, and you need to pass special options and/or set the
CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS environment variables to add directories to the
search patch for libraries (Or if you had to do something beyond
what's in the provided hint file), please file a report at
https://github.com/pennmush/pennmush/issues telling us what you had to
do so the hints can be added to the next release.
